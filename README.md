# Simple Gradebook
A really simple school gradebook

This is my first time working in C++, 
so the goal for me here is to learn 
how to write my own data structures 
and implement them properly, at least 
until I officially take my university's 
Data Structures course this Fall semester.

Planned Features:
* ~~Hashmap to store the class name and grades as key and value~~
* Singly-linked list to store the grades
* A "student" class that allows a user to access a student's gpa, course list, and grades
* (Very in the future) A basic gui to display desired data
